I'm a Junior Full Stack Web Developer.

My deployment toolset:
- Apache Lounge (HTTP server).
- Docker.

My backend toolset:
- TypeScript.
- Express.
- Braintree (payment).
- Twilio (sms).
- SendGrid (email).

My frontend toolset:
- Bootstrap.
- JQuery.
- TypeScript.
- React.
- Electron (desktop).
- Capacitor (mobile).

👨🏻‍💻 I'm interested in cryptography, networking & multiple platforms distribution.

📖 Self-learning is my strength.

🛠️ I will always prefer Braintree for payment processing & Twilio with SendGrid integration for SMS/Email automation.
